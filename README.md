# Neural-Network-model-for-complex-concentrated-alloys


The advanced descitpions of the codes and databases are given in the [Wiki](https://github.com/EliseGarel/Neural-Network-model-for-complex-concentrated-alloys/wiki).
In this Readme, the Python and Matlab configurations needed are described as a starting point for using the repository codes. 

## Python
Python 3.8 was used to develop the neural networks models.\
Installing the missing package can be done through anaconda with conda install <package> or through pip install <package>. One should install: 
  - ``tensorflow`` : contains ``keras`` package, the functions of which allow to build a neural network models and to train it
  - ``pathos``: allow to execute task with parallel pool

## Matlab
Matlab 2019b was used to test multilinear regression with interactions on the data
