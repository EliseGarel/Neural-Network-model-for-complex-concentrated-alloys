## Databases content:
The databases are associating a composition measured by EDX with hardness and elastic modulus measurements. For Each composition, 5 nanoindentation test were carried out.

## The databases:
  - Raw_data                          : acquired data without any treatment
  - Raw_data_corrected                : acquired data with hardness H an elastic modulus E correction with respect to calibration measurment on fused silica
  - Raw_data_threshold_with_outliers  : corrected data with a H and E threshold (no negative or zero values)
  - Raw_data_without_outliers         : Q_test to find extremum outliers with a 0.05 confidence index, lead after a Shapiro normality test. There are only 5 values of H and E for each composition value, thus the normality test is not lead in perfect condition, though Shhapiro is adapted to small 
                                      samples.
  - Raw_data_without_outliers_averages: the Raw_data_without_outliers are grouped per composition, the hardness and modulus valus are averged and the standard deviations stdH and stdE are computed and added to the database as 2 supplementary outputs
## The codes
### ``model_fit module``

This Python module contains a fonction that allows to create and train a regression model of which parameters are chosen previously.\
It contains: 
``regression``: list of arguments must contain : 
- filename : allow to read the database file
- frac_train : training fraction of the database ( eg: 0.8)
- shape : input layer shape 
- input_list : header of the database columns containing the input data
- output_list : headers of the database columns containing the output data
- nb_layers : number of hidden layers
- list_neurones : number of neurones per hidden layers (eg : [5 , 10] is for a 2 layers networks with 5 and 10 neurones)
- output_neurones: number of outputs
- list_act: list of activation function for the different layers
- f_opt : optmisation function 
- crit_loss : loss criteria (eg: RMSE, MAE...)
- list_metrics: list of metrics for network evaluation
- nb_epochs: numper of epoches
- best_model_dir: directory in which the best model can be savec
- best_model_name: name of the .h5 file containing the best model 

It return the x and y values used fir train and test. The best model is saved in the best_model_dir directory. \ \ 

``regression`` calls ``get_model`` with the arguments: shape,nb_layers,list_neurones,output_neurones,list_act,f_opt,crit_loss,list_metrics. It return the neural network model.
